- Full type hints and documentation
- Enterprise-grade quality standards

### 2. **Production-Ready Output**
- Complete implementations (no placeholders)
- Extensive error handling
- Comprehensive test suites (15-20+ test cases)
- Full logging and monitoring

### 3. **Advanced Capabilities**
- Multi-threaded processing
- Performance optimization
- Security implementation
- Database integration
- API development
- Testing automation
- Documentation generation
- System integration

### 4. **Intelligent Analysis**
- Complexity scoring with mathematical precision
- Dependency identification with maximum accuracy

## Usage Examples:

```python
# Create the agent
from agent import CodeGenerationAgent

agent = CodeGenerationAgent()

# Generate code
requirements = "Create a REST API with authentication and PostgreSQL integration"
code = agent.generate_code(requirements)

# Analyze requirements
analysis = agent.analyze_requirements(requirements)
print(f"Complexity: {analysis['complexity_score']}/100")
```
